general
-------
+ write a nice README

language completeness
---------------------
+ fix up  the 5 euler tests and move the included base defines to compiler.ss
+ more tests for srfi-1
+ and port more basic r7rs tests from chibi
- assoc should support 3-arity comparator case, see member

core features
-------------
+ raise and friends
- characters
- call/cc, also unlocks (values ...) and friends
- numerical tower

technicalities
--------------
+ implement argument overflow logic in interp.c eval frame
- equals? needs implementation for vectors
- equals? should support cyclic structures, also dump_values and list?
- refactor type tagging, use all lower bits to signal immediate, to yield
  more non-immediate types
- reduce includes-graph
- fix tab behavior in linenoise

memory management
-----------------
+ write barriers so that the generational GC is safe under any set! set-car! etc
+ clean up generational GC work and remove extra logging, merge into master
+ use word-sized unmarking
- adopt a gc bench program like this https://www.hboehm.info/gc/gc_bench/GCBench.scheme
- clean up empty arenas at end, to find stuff that we failed to collect
- destructor-on-gc e.g. for ports? kinda requires a second, dumber GC tracking
  for these special objects. perhaps ok, there should be few of these...

performance
-----------
+ interp_env_entry should not be linked list
- lookup vectors could be weak references
- more symbols could be replaced with vectors (?)
