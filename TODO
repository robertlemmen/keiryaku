- get all chapters from little schemer to work with shallow modifications,
  except for the special cases below
- end-of-line token in parser
- .+ in parser
- define member*, this is in little schemers code but I don't understand what
  the star does....

    (define member*
    (lambda (a l)
        (cond
        ((null? l) #f)
        ((atom? (car l))
        (or (eq? (car l) a)
            (member* a (cdr l))))
        (else
            (or (member* a (car l))
                (member* a (cdr l)))))))
(member
  'chips
  '((potato) (chips ((with) fish) (chips))))
