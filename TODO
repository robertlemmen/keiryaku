- implement case, assv and friends, towards 02-chibi-derived 
- even more tests from chibi source
- support #true and #false long forms in parser
- properly scan heap for free block when request > 1 cell
- clean up empty arenas at end, to find stuff that we failed to collect
- restructure immediate representation
