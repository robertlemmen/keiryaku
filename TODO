language completeness
---------------------
+ more tests for srfi-1
- new parser/include does not honor EOF anymore or fails to complain about
  open expressions at end of file
- compiler support for port ops with default port
- assoc should support 3-arity comparator case, see member

core features
-------------
- raise and friends
- call/cc, also unlocks (values ...) and friends

technicalities
--------------
+ should (display ...) put quotes around strings?
- implement argument overflow logic in inter.c eval frame
- turn push-parsing into pulling style, move parser out of types
- equals? needs implementation for vectors
- equals? should support cyclic structres, also dump_values and list?
- refactor type tagging, use all lower bits to signal immediate, to yield
  more non-immediate types
- reduce includes-graph
- fix tabs in readline/linenoise

memory management
-----------------
- properly scan heap for free block when request > 1 cell
- clean up empty arenas at end, to find stuff that we failed to collect
- destructor-on-gc e.g. for ports?
- better gc with nursery, bump allocator and forwarding pointers

performance
-----------
- vectors could be direct pointers
- more symbols could be replaced with vectors (?)
