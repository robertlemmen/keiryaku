language completeness
---------------------
+ (apply + '(1 2 (+ 4 5))) can't be right
+ more tests for srfi-1
- assoc should support 3-arity comparator case, see member

core features
-------------
- non-repl script mode and shebang support
- raise and friends
- call/cc, also unlocks (values ...) and friends

technicalities
--------------
- write with linenoise should perhaps add to linenoise so that typing after
  output does not erase the output
- chibi does not display results when in script mode, we should do the same. but
  we seem to depend on isatty, which is different?
- implement argument overflow logic in interp.c eval frame
- turn push-parsing into pulling style, move parser out of types
- equals? needs implementation for vectors
- equals? should support cyclic structres, also dump_values and list?
- refactor type tagging, use all lower bits to signal immediate, to yield
  more non-immediate types
- reduce includes-graph
- fix tabs in readline/linenoise

memory management
-----------------
- adopt a gc bench program like this https://www.hboehm.info/gc/gc_bench/GCBench.scheme
- do not trace into tenured on young GC, needs write barriers
- properly scan heap for free block when request > 1 cell
- clean up empty arenas at end, to find stuff that we failed to collect
- destructor-on-gc e.g. for ports?

performance
-----------
+ interp_nev_entry should not be linked list
- vectors could be direct pointers (?)
- more symbols could be replaced with vectors (?)
