language completeness
---------------------
+ fix up  the 5 euler tests and move the included base defines to compiler.ss
+ more tests for srfi-1
+ and port more basic r7rs tests from chibi
- assoc should support 3-arity comparator case, see member

core features
-------------
+ raise and friends
- characters
- call/cc, also unlocks (values ...) and friends
- numerical tower

technicalities
--------------
+ implement argument overflow logic in interp.c eval frame. the call frame could
  just have a pointer entry that is dynamically allocated in these cases. 
- is extra_env_v really required, or could we just use a local?
- equals? needs implementation for vectors
- equals? should support cyclic structures, also dump_values and list?
- refactor type tagging, use all lower bits to signal immediate, to yield
  more non-immediate types
- reduce includes-graph
- the inlining around interp_eval_env does not seem to work, still shows up in
  call graphs
- double-check that simple tail recursions can actually be done in bound memory

memory management
-----------------
- adopt a gc bench program like this https://www.hboehm.info/gc/gc_bench/GCBench.scheme
- clean up empty arenas at end, to find stuff that we failed to collect
- destructor-on-gc e.g. for ports? kinda requires a second, dumber GC tracking
  for these special objects. perhaps ok, there should be few of these...

performance
-----------
- lookup vectors could be weak references. top bits need to be used to define
  which value within the heap object/offset
- more symbols could be replaced with vectors (?)
