language completeness
---------------------
+ more tests for srfi-1
+ and port more basic r7rs tests from chibi
- assoc should support 3-arity comparator case, see member

core features
-------------
+ raise and friends
- call/cc, also unlocks (values ...) and friends

technicalities
--------------
- write with linenoise should perhaps add to linenoise so that typing after
  output does not erase the output
- implement argument overflow logic in interp.c eval frame
- turn push-parsing into pulling style, move parser out of types
- equals? needs implementation for vectors
- equals? should support cyclic structures, also dump_values and list?
- refactor type tagging, use all lower bits to signal immediate, to yield
  more non-immediate types
- reduce includes-graph
- fix tabs in readline/linenoise

memory management
-----------------
- where do all the non-moving allocs come from? is there a way to reduce the
  number? it's env_bind and env_new together
- adopt a gc bench program like this https://www.hboehm.info/gc/gc_bench/GCBench.scheme
- do not trace into tenured on young GC, needs write barriers and that all
  objects that are allocated directly into tenured (nonmoving) are also roots
- properly scan heap for free block when request > 1 cell
- clean up empty arenas at end, to find stuff that we failed to collect
- destructor-on-gc e.g. for ports? kinda requires a second, dumber GC tracking
  for these special objects. perhaps ok, there should be few of these...

performance
-----------
+ interp_env_entry should not be linked list
- vectors could be direct pointers (?)
- more symbols could be replaced with vectors (?)
