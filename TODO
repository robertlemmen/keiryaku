language completeness
---------------------
- implement (apply ...) properly
- even more "derived" tests from chibi source
- turn push-parsing into proper REPL, towards (include ...)
- assoc shoudl support 3-arity comparator case, see member

core features
-------------
- call/cc

technicalities
--------------
- support #true and #false long forms in parser
- implement argument overflow logic in inter.c eval frame
- equals? needs implementation for vectors
- equals? should support cyclic structres, also dump_values and list?
- reduce includes-graph

memory management
-----------------
- properly scan heap for free block when request > 1 cell
- clean up empty arenas at end, to find stuff that we failed to collect
- destructor-on-gc e.g. for ports?
- better gc with nursery, bump allocator and forwarding pointers

performance
-----------
- symbols could be flyweights, perhaps not so great when we do boxed lookups?
- symbol lookup in env could use binary tree?
- symbols could be replaced by boxes during lookup?
