- turn push-=parsing into proper REPL, towards (include ...)
- equals? should support cyclic structres, also dump_values and list?
- equals? needs implementation for vectors
- implement case, assv and friends, towards 02-chibi-derived 
- clean up includes-graph
- even more tests from chibi source
- support #true and #false long forms in parser
- properly scan heap for free block when request > 1 cell
- clean up empty arenas at end, to find stuff that we failed to collect
- destructor-on-gc e.g. for ports
- restructure immediate representation
- symbols could be flyweights
- better gc with nursery, bump allocator and forwarding pointers
